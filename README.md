# deep-CNN-image-classifier
A first approach to building a deep CNN image classifier with tensorflow library using jupyter notebook (python).

This project was part of a task which I had to pass in order to be recruited in a team fro developing UAV autopilot systems.
The task consists of building a deep learning model which is able to distinguish betwwen photos of cats and dogs, using the Kaggle dataset.
A detailed explanation of the project is provided in the file 'documentation_CNN_image_classifier' and a brief power point presentation in the file 'presentation_CNN_image_classifier'.
The source file with the code is the 'ai demo' file, while the 'models' folder contains the serialized model and the 'log' folder is used for tracking the model training. The 'dummy' folder consists of screenshots of the project and the 'ai2' contains the training data.
The 'documentation2_ASAT' and 'presentation2_asat' are respectively the documentation and the presentation mentioned above in greek.
Finally, the 'dogtest' and 'cattest' images are used for the model evaluation.
